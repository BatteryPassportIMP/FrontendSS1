        <p class="lead">The Battery Passport compiles battery legislation requirements to provide information for battery stakeholders throughout the entire battery lifecycle. The EU have developed newly proposed regulations (Doc. 52020PC0798) and these regulations require the development of a battery passport.</p>

                <p>The team was tasked with developing a battery passport to meet the newly proposed regulations. The primary goals of the passport including: 1. enabling transparency regarding the CO2 footprint of batteries 2. improve battery recycling and 3. minimise human exploitation that commonly occurs during mining and extraction of the raw materials required for batteries.
